CountryTime
=============
A souped-up version of the country_select helper that was originally in Rails core and then extracted into its own plugin. Please note that this will probably not be compatible with the country_select plugin itself.

CountryTime uses code from the country_select helper by Michael Koziarski, and the country_codes plugin by James Brooks. Further enhancements by Francis Hwang.
